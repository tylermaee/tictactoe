The game is designed for two players who take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. 
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

Winning Detection: The game automatically detects when a player has achieved three marks in a row, signaling the end of the game.

Input Validation: The program validates user input to ensure that moves are within the valid range and that players cannot overwrite existing marks.
